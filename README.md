# My Personal Website - `jordancarson.dev`

This repo was forked and modified to fit my needs. Shout out to Tim for creating this project. [Tim Deschryver](https://timdeschryver.dev/).


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd jordan-carson.github.io
npm run install
```

Run locally..
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
